We are a newly hired pokémon scientist that have been tasked with finding the ultimate pokémon team by Professor Oak. At our disposal we have the trusty Pokédex. Our goals with this analysis is to:

* Look through the Pokédex to familiarize ourselves with the data. (Inspect the data in pokemon.csv)
* Double check that the Pokédex entries are correct and contain the information we need. (Cleaning the data so its ready for analysis)
* Define conditions that goes into the ultimate pokémon. (Develop questions for analysis)
* Analyze pokémon based on attributes to find the ultimate pokemon team. (analyze variables within the data to gain patterns and insights on these questions)

The data in the pokedex has been collected by trainers all around the world of pokémon to create the best pokemon encyclopedia.

(The Data for this project was downloaded from Kaggle:)
